# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe 

A web-based Tic Tac Toe game.

## Project Description

Build a Tic Tac Toe web-based game from scratch using HTML, CSS, JS / jQuery. The game is played on a browser by clicking on the board. 

### Challenges
When you are minimising the window's width, the background image would crop with image ratio, which results in a white background on the bottom of the page.

Game is not tested on mobile, therefore, is best used on computer with full sized browser.
