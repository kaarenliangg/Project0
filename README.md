# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe 

A web-based Tic Tac Toe game.


## Project Description

Build a Tic Tac Toe web-based game from scratch using HTML, CSS, JS / jQuery. The game is played on a browser by clicking on the board. 

## How to Play
Click the board to fill the board with 'X' and then 'O'. Once you are able to connect 3 together on the board, you win! 

The game is able to keep track of your scores. After each round, click on the reset button to clear the board.

To reset scores, please refresh the browser.

## Challenges
When you are minimising the window's width, the background image would crop with image ratio, which results in a white background on the bottom of the page.

Game is displayed properly on mobile. The transitions are quite slow. User experience is best on desktop.
